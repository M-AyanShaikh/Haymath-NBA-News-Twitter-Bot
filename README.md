# Haymath-NBA-News-Twitter-Bot
This Twitter bot utilizes the Twitter API (through the use of the Tweepy library), to scan Twitter for tweets with                    keywords and retweets them, acting as a one-stop tweet shop for particular NBA players. This bot specifically  retweets tweets related to upcoming NBA superstars LaMelo Ball and Zion Williamson. However, what sets this bot apart from others is that the bot can be redesigned to retweet any tweets with any kind of keyword with minimal changes!
